His parents were druids who served the local community by using their magic to help with the harvest and keeping the peace. When Reagen was old enough, he began his training to become a druid. He quickly learned that he had a natural affinity for magic and was able to use it to help the villagers in ways his parents never could.\n\nAs he grew older, Reagen began to feel a calling to explore the world beyond the forest. When he was 20, he said goodbye to his parents and set out on his own. He has been travelling ever since, using his magic to help those in need and learn more about the world around him.\n\nReagen is a strong believer in the druidic code of respect for nature and duty to help others. However, he is also stubborn and introverted, preferring to work alone. He has a sharp mind"
