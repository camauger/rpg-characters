From a young age, they were fascinated by the ships that came into port and the stories their parents would tell of far-off lands. When they were old enough, they set out to sea, eager to explore the world for themselves.\n\nThey quickly learned that the life of a sailor was not as glamorous as they had imagined. The days were long and the work was hard, but they loved it. They made a name for themselves as a skilled navigator and an expert in reading the weather.\n\nOne day, while sailing through the treacherous waters off the coast of Chult, their ship was attacked by pirates. Most of the crew was killed, but Farlay managed to escape. They swore to find the pirates responsible and bring them to justice.\n\nThis quest has brought them to the city of Baldur's Gate, where they hope to find clues to the pirates' whereabouts. However, they are not the only one looking for the pirates. There are others who would kill to get their hands on the bounty. Farlay must be careful not to let their quest for revenge consume them."
