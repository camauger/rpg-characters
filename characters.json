However, this harmony was shattered when an ancient blight, long buried beneath the stones of Hammerfast, awakened.

Though they prevailed, the ordeal left Lewes with a deep scar, a whisper of some greater, unseen threat.\",\n    \"motivations_and_mystery\": \"Haunted by the incident, Lewes now seeks to understand the source of this corruption, fearing that what they had encountered was merely a symptom of a far greater danger.
