He left home at a young age to join his father's crew and has been sailing ever since.\n\nZak has always been a bit of a rebellious spirit. He's gotten into a lot of fights and has even been arrested a few times. But he always manages to talk his way out of trouble. He's also a bit of a womanizer and has broken a few hearts in his day.\n\nThe one thing that Zak is really good at is sailing. He's an expert navigator and has a natural talent for it. He's also a master of knots and can tie them faster than anyone else on his crew.\n\nZak is currently sailing on the Sea of Swords. He's been hired by a group of pirates to help them find a lost treasure. He's not sure what the treasure is, but he's excited to find out. He's also hoping that this adventure will help him find out more about his own heritage."

The search was successful, and Blair discovered many ancient artifacts that shed new light on the history of Illusk. She also uncovered a dark secret: the city had been destroyed by a powerful creature that had been trapped inside it.\n\nBlair has since returned to Neverwinter, where she now works as a professor at the University of Silverymoon. She continues to research the history of Illusk, and is determined to find a way to destroy the creature that destroyed the city."
