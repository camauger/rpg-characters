This event had a profound effect on her, and she vowed to find the killers and bring them to justice.\n\nShe left Daggerford and began to wander the land, learning what she could about tracking and survival. She also picked up some skills in thievery and stealth. After a few years, she tracked down the bandits who had killed her parents. She killed them all, but the experience left her feeling empty and hollow.\n\nShe continued to wander, eventually making her way to the city of Waterdeep. There, she met a group of adventurers and decided to join them on their quest to stop a group of cultists from summoning a demonic entity. She adventured with them for a while, but eventually left the group and struck out on her own again.\n\nNow, Malorie wanders the land, helping those in need and seeking to right wrongs. She is a skilled thief and an expert at sneaking around undetected. She is always on the lookout for new adventures, and is especially interested in uncovering ancient mysteries.",

        "background_story": "\n\nDoralynn Galaser was born in the small town of Nettlewood in the Forgotten Realms. Her parents were both gnomes who made their living as charlatans. They were always on the move, never staying in one place for more than a few days. Doralynn learned early on how to lie and cheat her way through life. She was always good at it, even better than her parents. When she was sixteen, her parents were caught by the authorities and thrown in jail. Doralynn was left on her own.\n\nShe took to the road, using her skills to con people out of their money. She was good at it and never got caught. She lived a life of luxury, staying in the best inns and eating the finest food. But it was all a fa\u00e7ade. Deep down, she was empty and alone.\n\nOne day, she met a man who changed everything. He was a Paladin of Tyr, a god of justice. He saw through her lies and convinced her to change her ways. She saw the error of her ways and decided to use her skills for good. She became his apprentice and began to fight for justice.\n\nNow, Doralynn is a Fighter in the world of Forgotten Realms. She still uses her skills to deceive and mislead her enemies. But she does it for the greater good. She is motivated by her desire to make the world a better place.\n\nOne potential adventure hook for Doralynn is that she is searching for the man who changed her life. She wants to thank him for showing her the error of her ways. Another potential adventure hook is that she is investigating a series of murders that have been happening in Nettlewood. The victims are all people who have been cheated by Doralynn in the past.",
