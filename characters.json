After graduation, she returned to Cormyr and took her place in the court.\n\nFor years, she served her kingdom and its people with distinction. She used her magic to protect them from harm and to help them in their times of need. However, there was always a part of her that yearned for more. She wanted to explore the world and see all that it had to offer.\n\nOne day, she heard about a group of adventurers who were looking for someone with her skills. She met with them and, after hearing about their quest, decided to join them. She knows that it won't be easy, but she is ready to face whatever challenges come her way.\n\nEssy's wild magic, a heritage of her half-orc bloodline, was something she had difficulty taming, leading to unpredictable surges of power. Despite the risks, Essy saw potential in this chaos, knowing that if she could learn to harness it, her power could grow beyond conventional limits. She hoped to eventually turn it into a tool for the greater good of Cormyr.\n\nThe pull of the open road led Essy on many quests with her band of adventurers.

But no matter the distance she traveled, her loyalty to her homeland remained unscathed. She longed for the day when her wild magic could serve the kingdom she loved.\n\nHer recent adventures, however, unveiled a foreboding prophecy from an ancient draconic tablet: a great calamity is to befall Cormyr. The enigmatic inscription seemed to refer to a dormant chaos, something that mirrored the wild magic within Essy herself. This revelation filled her with dread, yet it also offered an adventure hook: it hinted at the existence of a legendary artifact, the 'Heart of Chaos', said to possess the ability to control and harness wild magic. She believes this artifact could either save her kingdom or cast it into ruin, depending on who wielded it.\n\nWith a deep sense of responsibility, Essy returned to Cormyr, ready to delve into this mystery. Her newfound mission is to find the Heart of Chaos and control its power before it falls into the wrong hands, all while balancing the unpredictable forces within her own being. She is convinced that this path, full of peril and uncertainty, is her destiny. For the love of Cormyr and its people, Essy prepares herself to confront this challenge head on, no matter what awaits her in the depths of the unknown."

As she did, she had a vision of a great evil rising in the north.\n\nWhen she returned to her tribe, she told the shaman what she had seen. He said that she was chosen by the gods to stop this evil. She was given the title of Paladin and set out on her quest to stop the evil.\n\nOne possible adventure hook for Idelle is that she discovers that the evil she needs to stop is a group of bandits who have been terrorizing the area. She sets out to stop them and discovers that they are being controlled by a powerful wizard. She must stop the wizard before he can control more people and cause more chaos."
