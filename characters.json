She was always fascinated by the stories her grandfather would tell her of the druids who once lived there. When she was old enough, she left Daggerford to study under the tutelage of a cloistered scholar druid in Waterdeep. For years, she learned all she could about the natural world and the druidic ways. Eventually, she returned to Daggerford to take her place as the new druid of the Daggerfall Mountains. She is a wise and compassionate leader, always looking to help her community grow and prosper. However, she is also a deeply cynical woman, seeing the dark side of human nature all too often. Her duty is to her people and to the natural world, and she will do whatever it takes to protect them. She is a perceptive woman, always seeing the hidden motives of those around her. And yet, despite her cynicism,"
