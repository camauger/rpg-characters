Lauren Xanhel was born in the small town of Daggerford to a human mother and an Aasimar father. She grew up surrounded by stories of the great heroes of the Realms and dreamed of one day becoming one of them. When she was old enough, she left Daggerford to begin her studies at the University of Neverwinter.

During her time at the university, Lauren became fascinated by the cultures of the different races of the Realms. She decided to focus her studies on anthropology and set out to learn as much as she could about the different cultures of the world.

After graduation, Lauren joined the Rangers of Neverwinter and began using her knowledge to help protect the people of the Realms. She has since become one of the most respected Rangers in the organization and is known for her keen understanding of the cultures of the world.

Lauren is currently on a mission to track down a group of bandits who have been preying on small villages in the area. She is also searching for clues to the identity of a mysterious figure who has been leaving strange symbols at the scenes of the crimes.
