              Background Story
            </h3>
            <p style="font-family: BookInsanityRemake">
              

Codi Aaaan was born into a family of healers. Her mother was a renowned healer in the city of Silverymoon and her father was a member of the city guard. When Codi was five, her mother died of a rare disease. Her father did his best to care for her, but he was often away on duty and Codi was left alone. When she was thirteen, her father was killed in a raid on the city. Codi was devastated. She turned to her studies and threw herself into learning everything she could about healing. When she was sixteen, she met a woman who told her about the Haunted Ones. The woman said that Codi had the potential to be a great healer. She convinced Codi to join the Haunted Ones and promised to teach her everything she knew. Codi has been with the Haunted Ones ever since. She has developed into a skilled healer and has earned the trust and respect of her fellow Haunted Ones.
