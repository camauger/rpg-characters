Marley Ae was born to a human mother and a half-orc father from the Uthgardt tribe. Marley's mother died during childbirth, and their father was killed in a raid when Marley was only a child. Marley was then raised by their grandparents. As a child, Marley was always interested in the magical arts. When they were old enough, Marley left their grandparents to begin their own journey and learn more about magic.

During their travels, Marley met a wizard who took them under their wing and taught them the basics of magic. Marley quickly began to develop their own unique style of magic. After many years of study, Marley eventually became a powerful sorcerer.

Marley now roam the lands, using their magic to help those in need. They also search for any clues that might help them solve the mystery of their parents' deaths.
