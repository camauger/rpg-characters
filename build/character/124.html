Rosina Iaines was born into a noble family with a long legacy of warlocks. Her parents were both warlocks and her grandparents were as well. Her great-grandparents were the first in their family to be warlocks, and they passed down their knowledge and power to their children and grandchildren. Rosina was always a creative child, and she loved to use her imagination to create new things. She was also easily influenced by others, and she often followed the lead of her parents and grandparents. As she grew older, she began to develop her own power and learn how to control it. She also began to nurture her own creativity, and she became a powerful warlock in her own right. Today, Rosina is a respected member of the Warlock Council, and she uses her power to protect the people of Forgotten Realms.
