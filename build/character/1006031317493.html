Shem Opharadanis was born into a wealthy Waterdhavian family of Half-Elven heritage. His parents were kind and loving, and he had a happy childhood. However, when he was ten years old, his parents were killed in a carriage accident. Shem was the only survivor.

Orphaned and alone, Shem was taken in by his parents' closest friends, a couple who were also of Half-Elven heritage. They treated him like their own son, and he grew up happy and loved.

When he was eighteen, Shem's adoptive parents died of a mysterious illness. Again, he was the only survivor. Shem was devastated by the loss of the only family he had ever known.

 Seeking answers, Shem turned to the church. He became a Cleric, and devoted his life to serving the gods. He also began to research the mysterious illness that had claimed the lives of his adoptive parents, in the hope of finding a cure.

Shem's quest for answers has led him on many adventures. He has battled evil wizards, dragons, and demons. He has also made many allies, including a group of like-minded Clerics who share his quest to find a cure for the mysterious illness.

One day, Shem hopes to find the answer to the mystery that has haunted him all his life. Until then, he will continue to serve the gods and fight evil in the world.
