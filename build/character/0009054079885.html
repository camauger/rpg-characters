Amelia Ellean is a Cloistered Scholar and a Dragonborn. She was born and raised in the city of Waterdeep. Her parents were scholars who worked at the local library. Amelia was always curious and loved to learn. She would often sneak into the library to read when she was supposed to be doing her chores. When she was old enough, she enrolled in the local academy. She excelled in her studies and graduated at the top of her class.

After graduation, Amelia decided to join the city guard. She was quickly promoted to captain. She served the city for many years, until one day she was called to investigate a strange disturbance in the city. Amelia discovered a group of cultists trying to summon a demon. She was able to stop them, but not before the demon was summoned. The demon attacked Amelia and she was gravely injured. Amelia was able to kill the demon, but she was left with scars that would never heal.

Amelia retired from the city guard and became a Cloistered Scholar. She now spends her days researching the demon that nearly killed her. She hopes to find a way to destroy it and prevent it from harming anyone else.
