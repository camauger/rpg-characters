            <p style="font-family: BookInsanityRemake">
              

Born to a family of Venxanvenius, Mirabelle was always a bit different. She was born with a silver spoon in her mouth and always had the best of everything. But she didn&#39;t let that stop her from becoming a folk hero. She always had a heart for helping others, and she was always drawn to the Paladin class. When she was old enough, she left her family&#39;s estate and set out on her own. She quickly made a name for herself as a folk hero. She was always helping those in need and always fighting for what was right. She quickly gained the attention of the Order of the Radiant Heart, and they recruited her into their ranks. She quickly rose through the ranks, and eventually became one of the most respected Paladins in the Order. She always strived for balance in all things, and she always fought for what she believed was right.
