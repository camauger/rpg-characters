Sibelle Vivelmi was born in the small village of Barovia to a family of traveling performers. Her parents were both bards and taught her everything they knew about music, dance, and the art of storytelling. From a young age, Sibelle showed a natural talent for the lute and was often asked to perform for the village elders. She was happy to oblige and quickly became known as the best entertainer in Barovia.

When she was sixteen, her parents were killed by a pack of vampires while they were on the road. Sibelle was devastated by their loss but refused to let their memory fade. She vowed to continue their work and keep their legacy alive.

Sibelle has since traveled the world, performing for anyone who will listen. She uses her music to lift people's spirits and bring them joy, even in the darkest of times. She knows that her parents would be proud of her and that's what motivates her to keep going.

One day, Sibelle hopes to find the vampires who killed her parents and make them pay for their crime. Until then, she'll continue to bring happiness to those who need it the most.
