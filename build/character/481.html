Talia Rikiusenmir was born into a family of gladiators. Her father was a well-known druid who had retired from fighting to teach his daughter the ways of druidism. Her mother was a human who had also been a gladiator. Talia Rikiusenmir grew up learning how to fight and how to use her druidic powers to heal others. She always had a natural affinity for animals, and she would often sneak away to the forest to commune with the wild creatures there. When she was old enough, she joined her parents in the arena, fighting as a druid for the first time. She quickly proved herself to be a skilled fighter and a powerful druid. She quickly rose through the ranks of the gladiators, becoming one of the most popular fighters in the arena. When she was not fighting, she would often be found in the forest, helping the animals or communing with the spirits of nature. Talia Rik
