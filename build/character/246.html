              Background Story
            </h3>
            <p style="font-family: BookInsanityRemake">
              

Gabrila Er was born into a clan of dwarves who were known for their great skill in battle. However, Gabrila was not interested in fighting. She was more interested in the healing arts. When she was old enough, she left her clan to study under a great cleric. She learned much during her time with her mentor and eventually became a great cleric herself.

Gabrila has always been a very faith-filled person. She believes strongly in the power of her god and has dedicated her life to serving him. She has seen much pain and suffering in her travels and has always tried to help those in need.

Gabrila is a kind and compassionate person, but she can also be quite pessimistic. She has seen the dark side of humanity and doesn&#39;t always have hope for the future. However, she continues to fight for what she believes in and tries to make the world a better place.
