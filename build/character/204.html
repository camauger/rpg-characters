              Background Story
            </h3>
            <p style="font-family: BookInsanityRemake">
              

Ransell Iusval was born into a small Halfling tribe in the Forgotten Realms. When he was young, his tribe was attacked by a group of Orcs. Ransell&#39;s parents were killed in the attack, and he was taken prisoner. He was sold as a slave to a human lord, and spent the next several years working in the lord&#39;s mines. When he was sixteen, he was caught trying to escape and was sentenced to death. However, he was saved at the last minute by a group of adventurers who were passing through. The adventurers took him with them, and he eventually became their leader. Ransell has spent the last several years leading the group on various adventures, and has become a master of the Barbarian arts.
