              Background Story
            </h3>
            <p style="font-family: BookInsanityRemake">
              <br>Idelle Eldthorniusthorn was born into the Uthgardt tribe. She grew up learning the ways of the tribe and the skills needed to survive in the wilderness. When she was old enough, she became a member of the tribe's hunting party. She quickly proved herself to be a skilled hunter and tracker.<br>One day, while tracking a deer, she came across a strange stone. It was unlike anything she had ever seen before. She took it back to her tribe and showed it to the shaman. The shaman told her that the stone was a sacred artifact of the Uthgardt tribe. He said that it must be returned to the tribe's sacred site.<br>Idelle set out on the journey to return the stone. Along the way, she was attacked by a group of bandits. She fought them off and continued on her journey. When she arrived at the sacred site, she placed the stone on the altar. As she did, she had a vision of a great evil rising in the north.<br>When she returned to her tribe, she told the shaman what she had seen. He said that she was chosen by the gods to stop this evil. She was given the title of Paladin and set out on her quest to stop the evil.<br>One possible adventure hook for Idelle is that she discovers that the evil she needs to stop is a group of bandits who have been terrorizing the area. She sets out to stop them and discovers that they are being controlled by a powerful wizard. She must stop the wizard before he can control more people and cause more chaos.
