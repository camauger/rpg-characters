              Background Story
            </h3>
            <p style="font-family: BookInsanityRemake">
              

 Webster Vold was born into a noble family of druids who have been serving the Forgotten Realms for centuries. Webster was raised from a young age to follow in his family&#39;s footsteps and become a druid himself. He quickly rose through the ranks of the druidic order, and eventually became the head of his family&#39;s druidic circle.

 Webster is a skilled manipulator and politician, and has used his talents to great effect in the service of his order. He is a respected member of the druidic community, and is well-known for his dedication to his duty.

Despite his many accomplishments, Webster is a deeply pessimistic man. He believes that the world is doomed to destruction, and that the druids are all that stand between it and chaos. He is a tireless worker, but he knows that his efforts are ultimately futile.
