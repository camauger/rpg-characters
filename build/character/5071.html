            <p style="font-family: BookInsanityRemake">
              

Kennith Lynbri grew up in a small town in the Forgotten Realms. His parents were both bards, and they instilled in him a love of music and storytelling. When he was old enough, Kennith set out on his own to explore the world and learn as much as he could. He quickly realized that the world was not as fair as he had been led to believe, and he became determined to fight for justice. He became a knight, and using his bardic skills, he began to rally others to his cause. He quickly gained a reputation as a powerful fighter and a skilled leader. He has since dedicated his life to fighting for the oppressed and ensuring that everyone has a voice.
