Brocky Eld was born into a wealthy Waterdhavian family with a long history of public service. His father was a successful politician and his mother was a well-known socialite. Brocky was raised in luxury and privilege, but he was always aware of the elven blood in his veins. His mother would tell him stories of her homeland and he would often daydream about adventuring in the wilds of Faerun. When he was old enough, he convinced his parents to send him to a prestigious elven academy in the city of Silverymoon.

Brocky excelled in his studies and quickly became one of the top students in his class. He developed a keen interest in magic and history, and he dreamed of one day becoming a great wizard like his mother's people. However, his plans were derailed when his parents were killed in a freak accident. Brocky was suddenly the head of the family and he had to put his studies on hold to take up his father's political mantle.

For the next few years, Brocky devoted himself to his family's business interests and to Waterdhavian politics. He quickly rose through the ranks of the nobility and became one of the most powerful men in the city. But Brocky's heart was never in it. He longed for adventure and excitement, and he eventually came to the realization that his true calling was in the world of adventuring.

Brocky left his family and Waterdeep behind and set out into the wide world of Faerun. He quickly made a name for himself as a skilled fighter and a master of magic. He has adventured across the length and breadth of the Realms, and he has seen and accomplished more than most people could ever dream of. But Brocky is still searching for something. He feels like there is something more out there for him, some greater purpose that he has yet to discover.

Brocky Eld is an ambitious individual who is also overconfident. He is brave and adventurous by nature, and his main bond is with his family.
