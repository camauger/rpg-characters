              Background Story
            </h3>
            <p style="font-family: BookInsanityRemake">
              

Sharon Galmondis was born into a traditional family of wizards in the Forgotten Realms. From a young age, she was fascinated by the magic of her parents and the stories of the world they came from. When she was old enough, she began to study magic herself, determined to become the greatest wizard in the world.

However, as she studied, she realized that the world was much larger and more complicated than she had thought. There were so many different ways to use magic, and she became more and more interested in the different ways people used it.

Eventually, she realized that she didn&#39;t want to be a wizard like her parents. She wanted to be something new, something that no one had ever seen before. And so she became a sage cleric, using her knowledge of magic to help others and make the world a better place.

              Sharon Galmondis&#39;s ideal is innovation. Her flaw is overconfident, her bond is tradition, her behavior is easygoing, and her nature is energetic.
