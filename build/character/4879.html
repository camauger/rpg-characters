              Background Story
            </h3>
            <p style="font-family: BookInsanityRemake">
              <br>Burlie Emara was born to a family of sailors in the port city of Baldur's Gate. His father was a successful merchant marine and his mother was a shipwright. Burlie inherited his father's love of the sea and his mother's resourcefulness. He grew up sailing with his father and adventuring in the city. When he was sixteen, his father was killed in a shipwreck and Burlie was left to fend for himself. He took to a life of crime, using his skills as a sailor and his mother's resourcefulness to survive. He became a successful thief and con artist, plying his trade in the port cities of the Sword Coast.<br>One day, Burlie stumbled upon a group of pirates attacking a ship. He was about to steal from the ship when he heard the screams of the crew. He could not turn a blind eye to their suffering and intervened. He fought off the pirates and saved the crew. The captain of the ship, impressed by Burlie's bravery and skill, offered him a position in the crew. Burlie accepted and left his life of crime behind.<br>Years later, Burlie received a mysterious map from a dying man in a tavern brawl, pointing to the legendary 'Hoard of the Dragon Queen'. Overcome by curiosity, he decided to gather a group of adventurers to uncover the truth behind the map. Faced with the temptation of wealth, the allure of the open sea, and a chance to build his legacy, Burlie stands at the threshold of a grand adventure that could either cement his status as one of the greatest sailors of the Sword Coast, or lead to his downfall. <br>The adventure hook lies in the discovery of the map. The journey to the 'Hoard of the Dragon Queen' is filled with danger, mythical creatures, and uncharted territories. Burlie, being the brave and resourceful sailor that he is, prepares himself and his crew for the thrilling adventure that lies ahead. He believes that his cunning and wit, along with his sailing skills, will be their keys to survival. Burlie knows the risks involved, but the allure of the open sea, the promise of treasure, and the chance to further prove his worth are too enticing to resist.<br>However, there are whispers of rival pirates and treasure hunters also searching for the legendary hoard. A race against time ensues, fraught with danger and excitement, pushing Burlie and his crew to their limits. His prideful nature could be his downfall if he lets it get the best of him. As the quest unfolds, Burlie will need to rely on his resourcefulness, loyalty, and mercy to navigate the treacherous seas and rivalries that stand between him and the Dragon Queen's hoard.
