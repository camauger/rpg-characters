                <p class="character-text">
                  Ortensia Iusmir was born in the city of Waterdeep, the daughter of a Tiefling spy and a human cleric. Her parents had met while her father was on a mission for the Lords of Waterdeep, and her mother had been sent to aid him. Ortensia was raised in a loving home, but her parents were often away on missions, leaving her to be cared for by her extended family.

As she grew older, Ortensia began to follow in her parents' footsteps, learning the skills of a spy and a cleric. She was a natural at both, and soon she was able to combine her skills to become a powerful force in the city. She was often called upon to help the Lords of Waterdeep with their missions, and she quickly gained a reputation as a reliable and trustworthy ally.

Ortensia's motivations are simple: to protect the people of Waterdeep and to uncover the truth behind the mysterious events that have been occurring in the city. She is determined to uncover the secrets that the Lords of Waterdeep have been keeping, and to bring justice to those who have wronged the city. Her potential adventure hook is to investigate a series of strange disappearances in the city, which may be connected to a powerful cult that is operating in the shadows.
