          <p>Welcome to our RPG Character Showcase!</p>

          <p>
            Our site is dedicated to bringing to life a diverse array of
            characters from the realm of Role-Playing Games (RPGs). We believe
            that every character has a unique story to tell, and we're here to
            share these stories with you.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Our Characters</h2>

          <p>
            Our characters are more than just avatars in a game. They are
            carefully crafted entities with distinct attributes such as age,
            gender, ethnicity, class, subclass, and background. Each character
            is unique, with its own personality and backstory.
          </p>

          <p>
            Whether you're looking for inspiration for your next RPG campaign,
            or you simply enjoy exploring the rich tapestry of characters that
            the RPG world has to offer, we're sure you'll find something to
            pique your interest here.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Our Process</h2>

          <p>
            Our characters are generated using a sophisticated Python script
            that combines randomness with a set of predefined rules to create
            diverse and interesting characters. The script also manages the
            characters, storing them in a JSON file, and even supports image
            optimization and Discord bot integration.
          </p>

          <h2 class="mt-4 mb-3">Explore and Enjoy</h2>

          <p>
            While our current site functionality is focused on displaying
            characters, we have big plans for the future. We're working on
            adding features that will allow you to interact with the characters
            in new and exciting ways.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the meantime, we invite you to explore our collection of
            characters. Dive into their stories, imagine their adventures, and
            let them inspire your own RPG journeys.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you for visiting our site. We hope you enjoy your stay in our
            world of characters!
